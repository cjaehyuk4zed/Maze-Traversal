# Maze-Traversal
Simple Maze Traversal Program by Jaehyuk Chagn

This is a simple program which will find the shortest path from the starting point to the finishing point of a maze.

The program will take a file input (e.g "maze.txt") containing a maze with the correct parameters as shown below : 

9 10        row_size  /  column_size
**********  maze layout
*     *  *
* ****** *
*       **
** **   **
*    *  **
*  **    *
*        *
**********  start_coords / finish_coords
1 1 6 7     row  /  col  /  row  /  col
    
The parameters are also listed in the "parameters.txt" file. There are also a few example mazes (in .txt file format) to help understand how the program works.
