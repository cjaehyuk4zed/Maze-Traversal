# Maze-Traversal
Simple Maze Traversal Program by Jaehyuk Chang

This is a simple program which will find the shortest path from the starting point to the finishing point of a maze.

The program will take a file input (e.g "maze.txt") containing a maze with the correct parameters as shown in the "parameters.txt" file.
There are also a few example mazes (in .txt file format) to help understand how the program works.
